## Fishing Cast Distance Data

* This data was gathered with [a mod that shows the tiles away that a cast is](https://github.com/Zamiell/stardew-valley/blob/master/BobblerDistance.cs).
* All data below assumes a perfect cast. However, in every circumstance that I have tested, getting a near-perfect cast is identical.
* The farthest you can get is 5 tiles away from land.
